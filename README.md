# router2
The second try for writting a normal and simple router tag

## How to?

Wanna see it in action? Check [the demos](router2-demo.m3c.space/demo)

Is it working? Check [the tests](router2-demo.m3c.space/test)


Still I've to develop two main things
1. Complete the test and development for events 'show' and 'hide'
2. Add the attribute src in order to import from an URL. Like script tag.
3. Add a config to define how to hide/show/hide the containers
4. Add a relative tag. The idea is located at test/case2
5.
