# router3
The second try for writting a normal and simple router tag

## How to?

Wanna see it in action? Check [the demos](http://router2-demo.m3c.space/demo)

Is it working? Check [the tests](http://router2-demo.m3c.space/test)


Still I've to develop some things...

1. Add a relative tag. The idea is located at test/case2 (is it necessary?)

Check the demos' source code. They can give you a big picture about what I want to develop.
